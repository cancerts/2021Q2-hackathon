## Introduce 
Everyone knows how voting happens at a hackathon, so let’s skip the talk and list the features of this hackathon DAO.
- There are three roles: hackathon admin, hackathon BUIDL (project), hackathon judge.
- Every DAO has a hackathon bank. Hackathon prizes can be injected into the DAO bank. Multiple ERC-20 tokens can be injected into the DAO bank.
- Admins can add judges to the DAO.
- A registrar as an entry to all BUIDLs.
- Every judge has three votes. A judge can vote for any project and cast more than one vote to a BUIDL.
- Every BUIDL team has three votes. BUIDL teams can vote for any project except their own projects.
- Every admin can approve or remove a BUIDL from the registrar.
- When the hackathon ends, admin can close the voting process, the DAO then calculates every BUIDL’s total votes and percentage votes (buidl_votes / total_votes).
- BUIDL teams can claim prizes and take back a basket of tokens proportionally to their votes received.
